# Backend

- [x] setup postgresql database.
- [ ] setup routes
  - [x] /auth/signin (POST)
  - [x] /auth/signup (POST)
  - [ ] /files/upload (POST): upload a file to filebase
  - [ ] /files/:id (GET): get file and extracted data.
  - [ ] /files/:id/extract (POST): extract data from given file and create an extraction record.
- [x] refactor: each file should be suffixed with the folder name. e.g: auth_schema, get_files_route.py, file_model.py
- [ ] refactor: the db/models/file_models contains multiples models, its better keep one model per file.
- [ ] refactor: some folders (db, dependencies, schemas, etc) should be inside app/ folder, so we have only config files in root dir.

# Frontend
