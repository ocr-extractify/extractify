In this video I’d like to introduce you to the Extractify system.
It was developed for users who need to extract data from a large number of files.
So, we created a system where the user can automatically and quickly extract this data from their files.

Here is the login screen, where the user can log in to the system.
I’ll enter my credentials.
If the user doesn’t have an account yet, they can create one by clicking on this Sign Up link.
I’ll log in to the system.

After logging in, the user is redirected to the Create Extraction screen.
Here, the user can select the files they want to extract data from, and also configure the fields they want to capture.
In this example, I’ll use a few receipts from my university.

In these files, I know there are two types of fields:

the date (which can be the due date or the issue date) and the amount

So here, I’ll define the field to extract the date, using regex.
I’ll select the field type as Date.
Then I’ll add a new field called Amount.
I’ll select a regex for monetary values.

Next, I’ll attach three files — three receipts.
Now I’ll click the Create button.

The system is processing the files.
After processing, the user is redirected to the Results screen.
Here we can see the uploaded files and the extracted data.

For example, in Receipt 1, two dates were extracted: October 4th and October 10th, along with the amount of 396 reais.

The user can confirm these values if they wish by clicking the File button.
That opens the image of the uploaded file.
Here we see the amount of R$396, the issue date (October 4th), and the due date (October 10th).

We can also check the data for the other two files: one with R$390 and another with R$443.

The user can also export this data to a CSV file.
With this file, they could import it into another system, or open it in Excel to perform a deeper analysis if needed.

The user can also rename the extraction to make it more intuitive.
For example, I can rename it to University Receipts.
After pressing Enter, the extraction name is updated.

In the Statistics tab, the user can see the total value extracted, which in this case is 1,230 reais, the sum of the three amounts.
They can also see the number of files processed, which here is 3.

So far, we’ve seen the two main screens: Create Extraction and Results.
Now I’ll show the additional screens.

Here is the List Extractions screen.
It shows all the extractions created by the user.
The user can search to filter results or delete extractions if desired.

There’s also the Statistics screen, which shows system-wide statistics.
For example, the total number of files processed so far is 12.
And today, 12 files were processed.

We also have the Appearance screen, where the user can change the theme.
For example, they can select the Dark Theme.
Or choose from other themes available in the system.

They can also change the system language.
Currently, it supports English, so if they prefer, they can switch to English mode.

There’s also a screen to update the password, if needed.

And finally, there is the List Users screen, where all system users are shown.
For now, it only shows my account: vitorrobertos3022.com.
